I'm in week 2 of a [new job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanstewart/) at Adobe and with [MAX](https://max.adobe.com/) wrapping up, this seemed like a good time to talk a bit about the new role and get back into the blog after a 5 year hiatus. 

After an amazing experience leading the product management team for Adobe I/O, I've moved over to the Creative Cloud and joined their Developer Platform Ecosystem team to help drive the cloud extensibility strategy. For me, it's part homecoming and part an opportunity to focus on a specific community of developers and help grow the Creative Cloud.

The group I've joined has already been making progress in opening up multiple parts of the Creative Cloud for developers. With [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) as a focus, the team has been helping developers [create plugins](https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/) for the desktop tool and just this week helped make an [initial set of XD APIs](https://adobexdplatform.com/cloud-content-api-docs/) available to developers. 

The team has also built a number of integrations to showcase the kinds of experiences developers will be able to create with the APIs we're looking to make available more broadly in 2020. They've built integrations with [Slack](https://adobeio.slack.com/apps/A7P35MCT0-adobe-creative-cloud), [MS Teams](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104381222?tab=Overview), and [Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1219582/adobe-xd-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) that highlight the kinds of connected workflows we want to facilitate that put design and creativity at the center of collaboration. 

At MAX you saw the rollout of [Cloud Documents for Photoshop](https://helpx.adobe.com/sea/photoshop/using/cloud-documents-faq.html), and [enhancements to Creative Cloud Libraries](https://theblog.adobe.com/creative-cloud-libraries-putting-all-your-assets-at-your-fingertips-and-making-collaboration-easier-than-ever/) that are both examples of how we want to enable better collaboration, streamline design across multiple devices, and set the stage for future cloud-powered workflows. 

Realizing the full potential of those workflows is where developers will be so critical. We want to help developers build their own integrations and their own custom features on top of the services that our own tools use. By opening up our services and making it easy to create plugins for our tools, we know that developers will create things we never imagined that will help our customers be more productive.

I'm incredibly excited about the new job and can't wait to share more about what we're up to.
