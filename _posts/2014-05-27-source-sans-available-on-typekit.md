According to the Typekit blog, the newest open source font from Adobe, Source Serif Pro, is [available via Typekit](http://blog.typekit.com/2014/05/20/source-serif-pro/). I love the entire Source family ([Sans Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/source-sans-pro), [Code Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/source-code-pro), and now [Serif Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/source-serif-pro)) and it's what I use on this site.

The blurb on Typekit does a great job of describing the font

>A fresh take on the transitional style, Source Serif was designed as a companion to Source Sans. Their close relationship was achieved through a careful match of letter proportions and typographic color. Designed for a digital environment, the letter shapes for Source Serif are simplified and highly readable. The historical background, in combination with a high technical standard, gives the typeface a strong character of its own, lending itself to setting extended text on both paper and screen.

Currently there isn't an italic version, but [it's in the works](https://github.com/adobe/source-serif-pro/issues/2).

In addition to using it on Typekit, you can keep tabs on it over on [Github](https://github.com/adobe/source-serif-pro).
