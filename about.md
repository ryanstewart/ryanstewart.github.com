![Getting ready to climb](/img/ryan-about.jpg)

I'm currently a product manager for Adobe working on web tools. Prior to that I spent 5 years as an evangelist on Adobe's platform team covering a variety of products. Even further back I worked for a couple of startups and developed rich Internet applications for the [Wharton School](http://wharton.upenn.edu/). I also had a [blog for ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/stewart/) way back once upon a time.

I live in the awesome Seattle neighborhood of Ballard and in my free time I end up [drinking a lot of beer](https://untappd.com/user/ryanstewart) while trying to get outdoors to do climbing, hiking, and backpacking. I also have two young kiddos that make my life way more exciting than it would be otherwise but cut down on my outdoor time.
